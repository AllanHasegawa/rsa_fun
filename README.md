# rsa_fun

rsa_fun is an educational project developed. It's an implementation
of the RSA algorithm described in ("Algorithms", Dasgupta; Papadimitriou;
Vazirani, 2006).


It is *NOT* an optimal solution. High performance functions already implemented
and available in open-source libraries were not used, apart from basic
arithmetics with GMP.
